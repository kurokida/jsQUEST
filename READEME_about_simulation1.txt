# Simulation programs
All the files used in the simulation are contained in Simulation programs. 
There is one MATLAB file, and the rest of the files are for jsQUEST.

# The analysis was done using the following three files
- analysis2.R
- jsQuest_20210819.csv
- originalQuest_20210819.csv

The jsQuest_20210819.csv was created from the jsQuest_raw_data.csv filtered by the trial_index = 40.
The originalQuest_20210819.csv was created by merging files the QUEST_simulate_Quantile.csv, the QUEST_simulate_Mean.csv, and the QUEST_simulate_Mode.csv in the MATLAB-based QUEST raw data.

Each time is the average of the 40 trials. We did not record the time of each trial.
